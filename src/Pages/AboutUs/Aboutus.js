              Western dev society plans on holding both in person and online
              events for the upcoming 2022-2023 school year. Running live events
              for the WDS and Western communities comes at a very high cost.
              Therefore, WDS highly appreaciates and welcomes any financial or
              in-kind sponsorships
              <br />
              <br />
              There are many benefits that come with collaborating with our
              association! Partnering with WDS means that we will share and
              promote your organization&#x27;s marketing material to the Western
              Engineering &amp; Computer Science and greater Western community.
              You&#x27;ll also have opportunities to directly engage with the
              student population through sending representatives from your
              company, and/or through other collaboration formats. This is great
              for recruitment purposes!
